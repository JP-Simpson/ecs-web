The Shelf Recommendations project was lunched in 2018 to present information on the status of the extended continental shelf submissions. Our goal is to provide a visualisation of the areas of extended continental shelf and an examination of the recommendations made to States by the Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf (the Commission).

As coastal states are presenting their submissions to the Commission, it is useful to have an accessible record of previous recommendations. Since 2008 the Commission has developed understandings, devised consistent approaches and precedents with respect to the characteristics of continental margins and the application of Article 76 of the Convention. This website provides an analysis of the Commission’s general view on matters such as the submerged prolongation of the landmass of coastal States, the implications of seafloor highs and particularly oceanic seafloor spreading ridges and sediment transport deposits. It is hoped this information will assist States in making a successful submission to the Commission.

The information and data provided has been collected from the published submission executive summaries, summaries of recommendations and full recommendations (from States that have given due publicity to the outer limit of their continental shelf in accordance with article 84 (2) of the Convention) available on the DOALOS website.

Data on the submissions and recommendations have been provided by the United States Geological Survey, the University of Sydney, the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate and GRID-Arendal. The project is majority funded by the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Mr Phil Symond’s participation is supported by the Australian Department of Foreign Affair and Geoscience Australia.w
